During this project, I focused on calculating summary statistics, which provide a quick overview of the data and are essential for initial data analysis. Here are some key takeaways:

Understanding Data Distribution: Summary statistics help in understanding the distribution, central tendency, and variability of the data. This includes measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance.

Key Metrics Calculated:

Central Tendency: Mean, median, and mode to understand the central point of the data.
Dispersion: Range, variance, and standard deviation to measure the spread of the data.
Percentiles and Quartiles: To understand the distribution of data points.
Tools and Technologies: Leveraged Python and libraries like Pandas and NumPy to efficiently calculate these statistics and gain insights into the data.

Practical Insights: This task highlighted the importance of summary statistics in identifying data patterns and potential anomalies early in the analysis process. It also underscored the need for a strong foundation in statistical concepts for effective data analysis.
